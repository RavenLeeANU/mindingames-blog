I'm **Wenrui Li**, the founder of **MindinGames**. I'm delighted to have this opportunity to connect with you all here. My academic journey led me to the **Australian National University**, and I currently make my home in China. My professional path has taken me across various cities such as Sydney, Tokyo, and Shenzhen, where I've honed my skills as an algorithm engineer.

As we navigate the exciting tides of the **AIGC era**, I'm keenly aware of being a small part of this massive movement. However, I'm eager to embrace the changes it brings and grow together with this wonderful community.

On this platform, I look forward to sharing:

- Insights into my **life** and **interests**
- Knowledge and experiences from my journey
- **Experimental products** aimed at enriching our lives

Stay tuned, and let's grow together in this era of innovation!
